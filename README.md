# Instagram Data Analysis Project

## 📊 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Instagram-style social media data to uncover user engagement patterns, content performance, and marketing insights. Using SQL, I explored user activity, hashtags, and engagement metrics to provide actionable recommendations for improving platform growth and user experience.
